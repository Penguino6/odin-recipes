        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Roti is a traditional Indian flatbread that is usually eaten with curries. It holds a<br>
            similar place as tortillas in hispanic/south american cultures. Unlike naan, which <br>
            is more well known, roti doesn't use any yeast and isn't served with a stuffing. It's super <br>
            easy to make and is a great addition to most meals!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the flour and drizzle a small amount of oil, about a teaspoons worth</li>
            <li>Slowly add the water until things start to come together.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You may not need the whole 1/4 cup of water, or you may need more. The important part is the consistency.
                     </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Knead the mixture, adding flour or water as needed, until it no longer sticks to anything</li>
            <li>Portion off a little ball and roll it in your palms to form a little ball</li>
            <li>Throw some flour down and use a rolling pin to flatten it</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You don't want it to be see-through, but it should be fairly thin</li>
                    <li>This is a good time to experiment with both portion size and thickness</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Once you've got it flat, throw it in a pan with medium heat until little air pockets form</li>
            <li>Flip it and let it cook until you get some nice brown spots on each side</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            This recipe takes some trial and error and you measure more with your heart than<br>
            anything else. Play around with portion size and how long you cook things until you find<br>
            a method that's perfect for you!
