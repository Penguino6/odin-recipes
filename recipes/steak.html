        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Steak with mashed potatoes and veggies is a staple meal that you can customize to your personal<br>
            preference. The steak mostly stays the same, but you can swap the veggies for whatever<br>
            your favorite veggies are, or just what you have in the fridge. My go-to are brussle<br>
            sprouts and asparagus, but I've used corn, carrots, mushrooms often find their way in, as well<br>
            as broccoli, green beans, peas, whatever you got!. As for the potatoes, you can make mashed<br>
            potatoes, baked potatoes, fries, whatever you want. For this recipe, we'll stick to my favorites,<br>
            which are mashed potatoes with asparagus and brussle sprouts. This recipe does require an oven<br>
            safe pan for the steak, but you can just cook the steak fully on the stove if needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak of your choice, I usually do NY strip</li>
            <li>4-5 russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 a bundle of asparagus</li>
            <li>1 cup of brussle sprouts</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of whole milk</li>
            <li>1/3 stick of butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To start, this recipe has a little prep work</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 425</li>
                    <li>
                        Pat the steak dry and season both sides with salt & pepper. Let it chill on the counter<br>
                        while you prep the veggies.
                    </li>
                    <li>Peel, rinse, and dice your potatoes</li>
                    <li>Cut the bottoms of the brussle sprouts, remove any yucky leafs, and cut them in half</li>
                    <li>Remove the bottoms of the asparagus. If you bend them from the bottom, they will just snap off.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>For the potatoes:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add them to a pot, cover with water, and boil</li>
                    <li>
                        Once they're tender all the way through, strain them and return them to the<br>
                        pot, but with the heat off
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the butter in small chunks along with the milk and mash</li>
                    <li>Season with salt & pepper and you're done.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>For the veggies:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add your veggies to a bowl with the oil and salt & pepper</li>
                    <li>Toss them in the oil and spread them on a baking sheet</li>
                    <li>Cover the baking sheet tightly with foil and bake for 20-25 minutes</li>
                    <li>You'll bake them for an additional 10 minutes with the steak</li>
                </ol>
            <li>For the steak:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>To a hot pan, add some oil and sear the steak on one side for about 4 minutes</li>
                    <li>
                        Flip the steak, cover it and put the pan in the oven with the veggies for 10 minutes.
                   </li>
                   <li>Remove the steak, put it on a plate, and let it rest for about 10 minutes</li>
                </ol>
            <li>
                Finally, add everything to the plate with the steak. I like to pour the juices on the <br>
                potatoes and veggies.
            </li>
        </ol>
