        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Steak with mashed potatoes and veggies is a staple meal that you can customize to your personal<br>
            preference. The steak mostly stays the same, but you can swap the veggies for whatever<br>
            your favorite veggies are, or just what you have in the fridge. My go-to are brussle<br>
            sprouts and asparagus, but I've used corn, carrots, mushrooms often find their way in, as well<br>
            as broccoli, green beans, peas, whatever you got!. As for the potatoes, you can make mashed<br>
            potatoes, baked potatoes, fries, whatever you want. For this recipe, we'll stick to my favorites,<br>
            which are mashed potatoes with asparagus and brussle sprouts.
